- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt Hanson!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested all kinds of outdoor activities and built https://wasatchwind.github.io/ specifically for paragliding. I am interested in professional software development and engineering.
- ðŸŒ± I've been a Product Manager at Pluralsight.com since spring 2021 and learning as much as I can about software development. I built https://wasatchwind.github.io/ using vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, but I also created several data sources using Python and Nodejs in Google Cloud Run Functions: one uses FTP, one scrapes data with Beautiful Soup, and one takes screenshots using Puppeteer.
